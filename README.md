# reactGPT
*A React app that has been converted from a plain JS FastAPI version [fastGPT](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/FastGPT)*

reactGPT is a high performance, customizable GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 chat application built with FastAPI, React, and OpenAI's API. 

This app started as a [Flask](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/flaskGPT) app with a plain JavaScript frontend, then evolved to using [FastAPI](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/FastGPT) as the backend to take advantage of imporved performance with asynchronous support for OpenAI API requests. This project is the conversion of [FastAPI based FastGPT](https://github.com/AVGVSTVS96/FastGPT) from plain JavaScript to React to handle the frontend user interface.

reactGPT implements several features essential to providing an excellent user experience and offers a simple and concise implementation in code, ready to be built on and expanded. The code is efficient, well organized, and intuitive ensuring easy development and maintanability.
